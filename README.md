# Realizing 4-point Fourier Transform
This is a System Verilog code, to compute Fourier Transform. 
I could successfully run the simulation using SYNOPSYS VCS available commercially at EDA Playground.

Note: I had actually tried to use Verilog for this, but then it kept showing me that the ports declared needed to be packed and started giving me errors which doesn't seem to get resolved, which I ultimately got resorted to use SystemVerilog to do the same.
